    "Austin, Texas is the largest No Kill community in the nation, and home to the Austin Animal Center. They provide shelter to more than 16,000 animals each year and animal protection and pet resource services to all of Austin and Travis County. Annually over 90% of animals entering the center, are adopted, transferred to rescue or returned to their owners.\n",
